# Correlation-and-Regression

## Problem Statement
This problem is picked from Hackerrank - A Quick Recap - 1

Here are the test scores of 10 students in physics and history :

Physics Scores -   15  12  8   8   7   7   7   6   5   3

History Scores -   10  25  17  11  13  17  20  13  9   15

Compute Karl Pearsonâ€™s coefficient of correlation between these scores. 
Compute the answer correct to three decimal places.

Output Format :

In the text box, using the language of your choice, print the floating point/decimal value required. Do not leave any leading or trailing spaces.

For example, if your answer is 0.255. In python you can print using

print("0.255")

## Solution

Correlation :

* Correlation and regression both are analysis of multivariate data. multivariate analysis is nothing but the process of analysis variables.

* Correlation helps us to understand the association (or) absence of relation between variables.

Regression :

* Regression analysis predicts the value of dependent variable based on known values of independent variable, and it will help us to fit a line in between the data points(observations).

* Regression indicates the impact of one unit change in the known variable (x) on the estimated variable (y).

## Formula Used
